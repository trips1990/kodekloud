Last week, the Nautilus DevOps team deployed a redis app on Kubernetes cluster, which was working fine so far. This morning one of the team members was making some changes in this existing setup, but he made some mistakes and the app went down. We need to fix this as soon as possible. Please take a look.

The deployment name is redis-deployment. The pods are not in running state right now, so please look into the issue and fix the same.

Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host has been configured to work with the kubernetes cluster.


#use kubectl describe pod command and you will see that there is a typo in the name of configmap:

Warning  FailedMount  66s (x9 over 3m13s)  kubelet            MountVolume.SetUp failed for volume "config" : configmap "redis-conig" not found

#to check corret name:

thor@jump_host ~$ kubectl get configmap
NAME               DATA   AGE
kube-root-ca.crt   1      43m
redis-config       2      3m3s

#use "kubectl edit deploy redis-deployment" to update the configmap

     - configMap:
          defaultMode: 420
          name: redis-config
          
#check the pod status again and you will see its still failing, do describe pod again and you will see below error:

Warning  Failed     14s (x2 over 30s)  kubelet            Failed to pull image "redis:alpin": rpc error: code = NotFound desc = failed to pull and unpack image "docker.io/library/redis:alpin": failed to resolve reference "docker.io/library/redis:alpin": docker.io/library/redis:alpin: not found

# fix the typo in image name to "redis:alpine" and it should work fine.
